    "\n",
    "In this project, leading and lagging financial technical indicators were applied to cryptocurrency asset, Bitcoin, historical closing price to determine a trading strategy. The trading strategy was used to buy, sell, and hold assets and compared with a buy and hold strategy. Various closing resolutions and algorithms were explored for understanding but not all were documented. The resulting lower resolution closing labeled data of 2 hours was fitted with a stochastic gradient boosting algorithm, `XGBoost`, to predict a strategy based on time series close price and volume data plus derived data. Accuracy of learned algorithm was 95.4%. RSI proved to be the most important feature.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Traders, especially new traders, have a difficult time determining when he or she should enter or exit a market. Without objective data or signals, the trader or investor might choose to sit out of the market or buy and sell based on naive thinking. Experienced traders learn to read stock charts and leverage technical indicators and overlays to make trading decisions. Traders of traditional corporate stock assets use additional criteria such as P/E ratios, balance sheets, etc. Cryptocurrency assets do not have such information and must instead use social media sentiment/growth, developer capabilities, marketing strategy, liquidity, etc. Obtaining this information is difficult leaving the investor to rely on gut and traditional trading tools like technical indicators. In addition, cryptocurrencies trade 24x7 across various exchanges. \n",
    "\n",
    "A technical indicator is \"any class of metrics whose value is derived from generic price activity in a stock or asset [1].\" There are two kinds of techincal indicators, leading and lagging, that try to predict the future or general price direction of a security by looking at past patterns. Leading indicators signal future events. Lagging indicators follows an event. The importance of a lagging indicator is its ability to confirm that a pattern is occurring. There are many, many indicators. For this project, two popular indicators, relative strength indicator (RSI) and Bollinger bands (BB), are used to determine a trading strategy [4]. Through trial and error, the indicators were adjusted to fit the pattern of Bitcoin close price for daily and 2 hour samples. An algorithm was developer to incorporate both indicators to determine a trading strategy of *buy*, *sell*, or *do nothing*. This strategy was then applied to buy or sell the asset and the result compared to a buy and hold strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting labeled data for 2 hour closing price trading strategy was used to train a stochastic gradient boosting machine learning algorithm [5] to predict *buy*, *sell*, or *do nothing strategy* based on time series closing price and volume plus derived data. In addition, a feature ranking and example decision tree plots were provided for deeper understanding [6]. Future work in this project would include the following:\n",
    "- adding additional technical indicators to deteremine which ones provide the most value in determining trading strategy,\n",
    "- incorporating other cryptocurrency price history to determine if feature importance is the same,\n",
    "- automate data aquisition, labeling, and training of algorithm, and\n",
    "- develop a webservice to provide trading strategy for today or past days.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The historical pricing data for Bitcoin on Coinbase exchange was obtained from Kaggle with a one minute resolution [2]. This low level resolution allowed me to resample it for any desired resolution. For this project, the data was resampled to 2 hour and one day resolutions. The date range for the data was December 1, 2014 6 am to October 19, 2017 11:59 pm inclusive.  For the 2 hour resolution, only data for 2017 was used providing 3,500 signals. For the daily resolution, data for 2016 and 2017 was used providing ?? signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resampling of the data was performed with a `Pandas` rule. The rule is expressed in multiples of time. In this case time is one minute, so for a 2 hr resample the rule would be 120T = 2*60*T.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.resample(rule=\"120T\").agg(\n",
    "\t\t{'open':'first','high':'max','low':'min','close':'last','volbtc':'sum','volusd':'sum','wtdprice':'last'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "The details of the pricing data for Bitcoin obtained from Coinbase are the following:\n",

    "Technical indicators were then created from closing price leveraging a multi-platform tool for market analysis, `TA-Lib` [3]. This tool provides developers the capability of creating many technical indicators. I utilized the tool to create BB and RSI indicators. For BB, a 7-day simple moving average for middle band and a 1.5 standard deviation of the middle band to create upper and lower bands. For RSI, a 7-day average gain/loss was used.\n",

    "Reviewing the results yields a few insights. One, the buy and hold trading strategy produced better results than signal trading strategy; i.e., 1.79 sharpe ratio better for 2 hour sample. The algorithm should be explored to yield better results. Second, the 2 hour close sample yielded 12x more signal points than daily sample which is important to train a classifier. In order to use the daily sample, a larger sample size should be used. Third, the accuracy of the learned classifier was 95.4% with a standard deviation of 1.95% without tuning. Fourth, RSI features were 4.2x more important in classifying the signals than BB.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This project was able to label a Bitcoin dataset with an trading algorithm built on a combination of multiple technical indicators. The labeled data was used to successfully train a stochastic gradient boost algorithm, `XGBOOST` yielding a 95.4% accuracy. RSI proved to be the more important techincal indicator in classifying trading strategy. These results are limited to this dataset.\n",
