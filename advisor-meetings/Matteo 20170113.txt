â€” discussion about comments feedback

- general feedback
much more better than previous paper
easy to finish when we have everything
most of remarks are editorial
better to complete the project
take strategy and extend it
extend to include december
start writing some conclusion in paper
annualize summary data
focus on implemented strategy to better understand it and include other coins
started structure of the market
propose a strategy
our model is saying to buy and hold
we are the very beginning i note cryptocurrency history
futures just arrived
point is not to show it outperforms
buy and hold may be the best strategy
if in december, the model was able to spot the downward trend of the market then it would be better than buy and hold.
show we are working to exploring sentiment 

- marketplace
pool of cryptocurrencies versus us dollar to visualize
show visualization in october and december
does it look different with major market capitalization change

- sentiment
sentiment analysis is difficult
trying to get it to work is part of the research
show a timeline of sentiment (positive, negative) on top of price for a crypto.
try to extend current strategy to a longer period
finding relationships is effective to explain a new market
a starting point of sentiment analysis would be good.
pull sentiment data and classify it 
does it correlate with pricing for a currency?
